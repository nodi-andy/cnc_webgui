	The ongoing development of Hard- and Software makes it possible, that 
engraving systems can be driven directly out of DTP applications instead out of 
closed systems. Compairing them it is obvious that the new software packages 
like CorelDraw and others are offering all their possibilities like the huge 
amount of fonts and clipart also for engraving.

	With our Sigleline Engraving Fonts you are able to engrave small texts up to 25 
mm height with any engraving routines in the highest possible quality. 
Because of driving the some of the lines two times their is even more time to 
save because there is no more cleaning neccessary. 
	
	Here is a rule: Singleline Fonts will be engraved with engraving tools of 3 % – 
12 % (average: 8 % – 10 %) and 4-line engraving fonts with engraving tools 
of 3 % – 7 % (average: 5 % – 6 %).

	In many of the design software packages texts will be displayed with different 
measurements. To convert the dimensions:

	Desired versal height minus thicknes of the engraving tool multiplied 
by 1.5.
		Example: desired height = 10 mm
	8 % of 10 mm = 0,8 mm (10 mm - 0,8 mm) multiplied by 1,5 = 13,8 
mm height

	In the case that the measuring is typographic points, you have to 
devide the points by 0,3527. (13,8 mm height means 39 typographic 
points.

	To check if a 50 pt Height could be engraved with a tool of 1 mm, do 
as follows:
	50 pt height means 17,64 mm. 17,64 devided by 1,5 + 1mm thickness 
of the engraving tool means a versal height of 12,76 mm. 1 mm toll 
thickness means 7,8 % of 12,76 mm height.
